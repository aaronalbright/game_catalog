    <h1>GamesGalor Inc.</h1>

<p>Greetings, GamesGalor employee! Please use this site to enter new games as they are traded. Please note the price for which you paid for it is <em>not</em> the same as the price we will sell it for.</p>

<p>In case we <em>really</em> hired someone at the bottom of the barrel, here's a handy little guide made just for you.</p>

  <h2>How to enter a game.</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Look at the box. The name of the game is probably on the front it big letters.</li>
    <li>Look at the box again. The console the game is for is probably at the top. (It awalys is)</li>
    <li>If there is no sleeve (or no box), look at the disk and refer to steps 1 and 2.</li>
    <li>Ask the customer how much they paid for their game.</li>
    <li>Offer them half of half that price.</li>
    <li>Enjoy the look of confusion and sadness rush over the customers face.</li>
    <li>Answer any and all questions with "That's just what my manager tells me." Even if you're the manager.</li>
    <li>Take the game and give the customer their money.</li>
    <li>DON'T forget to get the customers initials.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Congratulations! You just made GamesGalor Inc. money. Now get to work.</p>
